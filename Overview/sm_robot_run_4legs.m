%% Mechatronic Running Robot
% This model shows how a running or walking robot can be modeled to
% support system design. This four-legged robot has compliant legs that can
% store and re-release kinetic energy. As such it is biologically-inspired
% by an equestrian trotting gait. The model can be used to support
% selection of leg length, leg spring stiffness and actuators. An objective
% could be to minimise power consumption for a steady trot at some nominal
% average forward speed. The DC power supply is augmented with an
% ultracapacitor which is sized to smooth battery currents and store
% regenerative electrical energy.

%% Contact Forces Between Feet and Floor
%
% Two methods are used for modeling the contact force between the foot and
% the floor.  One is used for the X-Y plane only, the other accommodates
% movement in any direction.  You can select the appropriate force for your
% test using a parameter in the leg subsystem mask.
%
% *Planar Contact Model*
%
% The planar variant of the contact force model assumes that the leg is
% moving in the positive global x direction and stays within the XY-plane.
% Simulink is used to model a spring-damper that connects the end of the
% leg to the floor at the exact location where it lands.  This
% spring-damper is deactivated when the foot leaves the floor.  This
% idealized form of a contact model is good for initial testing.

%%
% *Six Degree of Freedom Contact Model*
%
% This variant of the contact force model assumes the end of the leg is a
% sphere and detects collision between the sphere and the surface of the
% floor. It models contact and friction force between the sphere and the
% plane.  It is valid for all six degrees of freedom.
