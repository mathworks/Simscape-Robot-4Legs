%% Mechatronic Running Robot Limb Design
% This workflow example explains the steps of designing the limbs for a
% mechatronic running robot.  The workflow is executed using a series of
% parameterized models so that redesigns can be executed automatically. You
% can explore alternative design choices using MATLAB script 
% <matlab:edit('sm_robot_run_script_design_limb.m'); sm_robot_run_script_design_limb.m>.
%
% The resulting design is shown in <matlab:web('sm_robot_run_4legs.html'); Mechatronic Running Robot>

%% Step 1: Gait Selection
%
% This model implements an inverted pendulum gait model. It is assumed that
% the impact with the ground is lossless, and hence total energy of the
% system is always constant. The model can be used to explore the effect of
% leg stiffness, leg length, body mass and initial conditions on the
% trajectory. For designing a trotting quadraped robot, it can be used to
% pick leg stiffness given expected payload weight, leg length and desired
% gait frequency. This model uses SI units. An alternative is to use
% non-dimensionalized lengths which can give additional insights. Here the
% model is used to generate the ideal leg angle profile as a function of
% time during the stance. This is used by the sm_robot_run_04_actuator.slx model.
% 
% Model variables are as follows:
% 
% # [X,Y] is the position of the spring-supported mass
% # Px is the horizontal position of the foot when in contact with the ground
% # [U,V] are the horizontal and vertical speeds of the mass. 
% # Default parameters are: 
%
% * Leg length L=1m
% * Mass m=25kg
% * Spring stiffness k=5315N/m. 
% * Stance height (Y) = 0.85m i.e. the leg is 85% of unloaded length.
%
% With these choices, the feet are touching the floor for half of the
% overall gait period. The simulation starts in mid-stance with U=2m/s.
%
% These parameters present a design tradeoff.  Too much time in the aerial
% phase leaves not enough time to put in locomotive torque during stance.
% Conversely, too much time in the stance may not leave enough time to
% swing the leg forward ready for the next stance phase. A parameter sweep
% can help identify good parameter combinations.

% The plots below show the effect of stance height and spring stiffness on
% the percentage of time in a gait period that the leg is touching the
% floor.  A deeper crouch and a stiffer spring will lead to a higher leap
% and less time spent on the floor.

%% Step 2: Construct Trajectory of Leg Angle in Aerial Phase
%
% This model determines the trajectory of the leg angle for a chosen target
% gait. A step is made up of the stance and aerial phases.  Key parameters
% for the target gait are:
% 
% # The period of the body CG (T_cg)
% # The time spent in stance (T_stance)
% # The leg angle when the foot leaves the floor (leg_angle0)
% # The leg rotation speed when the foot leaves the floor (leg_vel0)
%
% Landing angle should be minus the take-off angle in order to replicate
% the ideal gait.  This model is for a bipedal gait, so the body will rise
% and fall twice during one cycle of a leg (time for leg trajectory =
% 2*T_cg).

%% Step 3: Determine Required Joint Torques
%
% This model determines the hip torque required during the aerial phase
% based on the gait modeled by the Simulink inverted pendulum model.

%% Step 4: Design Actuator
%
% This simplified actuator model is used for a number of purposes:
%
% # To determine a suitable gearbox ratio and motor rating.
% # Sizing the ultra capacitor for the power supply.
% # For preliminary motor speed and shaft angle control design.
% # A performance specification to a supplier if developing a
% bespoke solution.
% # As a subsystem in the complete model of the final running robot
% to validate the design or different gaits, loads and terrains.
