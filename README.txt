Running Robot Model in Simscape

This example shows how simulation tools can be used to support the
design of a running robot. See Hyde, R.A. and Wendlandt, J. "Tool-Supported Mechatronic System
Design", 34th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, 10-13th November
2008, Orlando, Florida for more background information.
